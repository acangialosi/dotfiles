#
# This DSC config file will format a 50 Gb Dev Drive volume onto Disk 0. It must be run with admin credentials 
# If there is no unallocated space the Disk dsc resource will attempt to resize the first volume that can be resized (shrinked)
# safely to create the unallocated space. A new hard partition will be created from this unallocated space and a new Dev Drive volume
# will be formatted into this new hard partition. Note: the AllowDestructive flag is used to signal to the disk dsc resource that if 
# it needs to resize an existing partition, it can do so. The disk resource also takes a flag called 'ClearDisk', Its important that
# you do not combine the usage of 'AllowDestructive' and 'ClearDisk' as this will clear the entire disk including pre-existing volumes.
# The 'AllowDestructive' flag should only be used when you do not know if there is already pre-existing unallocated space on 
# the machine. E.g when running the config file on different machines. Use either Dev Home's machine configuration page
# (admin option) or Winget Configure <path to this file> to run the config in an admin terminal window.
#
# See https://github.com/dsccommunity/StorageDsc/wiki/Disk for details about the parameters for the Disk resource.
